# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Considerations

This application handles API keys and user messages. Please follow these security guidelines:

### 🔑 API Key Security
- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- Store API keys in environment variables (`.env` file)
- Use different API keys for development and production
- Regularly rotate your API keys
- Monitor API key usage for unusual activity

### 🌐 Network Security
- The application uses CORS to control cross-origin requests
- API endpoints are configured with appropriate CORS policies
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Consider rate limiting for production deployments

### 📝 Data Handling
- Messages are not stored persistently by default
- No user authentication is implemented (consider adding for production)
- Chat history exists only in browser memory
- Clear chat functionality removes all local data

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email the maintainers directly (if available)
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for the issue to be addressed

### What to Include in Your Report
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices for Deployment

### Backend Security
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Add authentication and authorization for production use
- Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Add logging and monitoring for security events
- Keep dependencies updated

### Frontend Security
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Avoid storing sensitive data in browser storage
- Implement proper error handling to avoid information disclosure

### Infrastructure Security
- Use secure hosting platforms
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Regular security updates and patches
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Backup and disaster recovery plans
